# Anjan Shomodder's setup and deploy fullstack(MERN) application Project

This is a solution to the [Anjan Shomodder's setup and deploy fullstack(MERN) application Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ME3tMy5Q2qo). I'm testing my hand creating very simple (follow along) projects for now to get familiar with the matter.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup 
- CSS custom properties 
- Flexbox 
- CSS Grid 
- Mobile-first workflow 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library 
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework (No)
- Tailwind CSS  
- Typescript (No)
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- MongoDB

### What I learned

- Didn't write READMe on first build, only attempting this now after several refactors. But be rest assured that this was very useful!    

### Continued development

- More increasingly complex MERN stack projects.
